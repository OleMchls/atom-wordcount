# Atom wordcount package

## Feature Description

This package provides a real-time word count and character count in the status-bar for [Atom](https://atom.io).
It counts words and characters in the current document or in the selected text. By default, it will automatically activate on textfiles (files with these following extensions: *.md, .markdown, .readme, .txt, .rst, .adoc, .log, .msg*) and unsaved files. Users can also define which file extensions they want this package to activate.

This package also comes with other handy options, such as:
- Activate the word count on the status-bar on files with no extension.
- Exclude counting words and characters from code blocks defined by markdown syntax.
- Goal tracker with a progress bar shows your progress toward a word count number.

## Installation

From the Atom editor menus, navigate to *Atom -> Preferences*. From there, open the *Install* menu to invoke it.
The other way to get to this menu is to take advantage of command palette. Press <kbd>ctrl-shift-P</kbd> (Linux/ Windows) or <kbd>cmd-shift-P</kbd> (OSX) to bring up the command palette and then start typing <kbd>install</kbd>. You should see the *Settings View: Install Packages and Themes* option show up in the palette for you to select.

When you get to the *Install* menu, type <kbd>wordcount</kbd> in the search textbox and you should see this package with the author name <kbd>nesQuick</kbd> appear for you to install.
