# Atom wordcount package

Counts the words and characters in your current document and displays them in the status bar. Plus a handful of great features, like:

  - Activates automatically on text files (define on which file extensions you want to activate it, or turn it "Always on")
  - Counts the words and characters in your selection when you have made one (or multiple!)
  - Writing goal tracker (with custom colors support)
  - Works with unsaved files
  - Option to exclude `codeblocks` from count
  - Option to show the total price per word for the document. Currency symbol can be changed in Settings.
