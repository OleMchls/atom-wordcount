  - Counts the words and characters in your selection when you have made one (or multiple!)
  - Writing goal tracker (with custom colors support)
  - Works with unsaved files
  - Option to exclude markdown `codeblocks` from count
  - Option to exclude markdown `<!-- html comments -->` and `{>> critic markup comments <<}` from count
  - Option to exclude markdown `> blockquotes` from count
  - Option to show the total price per word for the document. Currency symbol can be changed in Settings.
  - Option to display the time to read estimation based on word count
